## Description
We created our own class that takes in all the information of the different Hotels... each Hotel is an instance of that class.  We created a method that echos out all the values of the properties.  So we just call that method for each object.

We tried to use as less as possible code with some great results.  Kept the program as modular as possible.  We encountered a some styling issues on the 3rd page almost at the end of the project so we decided to remove the 3rd page.

This is our first attempt at Object Orientated Programming
